Extracting multiple root domains from a CSV using print

from tld import get_tld
 
urls_file = "urls_file.csv"
#URLs should be in column A without a heading, in a CSV file named "urls_file.csv"
 
urls = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in open(urls_file)]
 
for url in urls:
    res = get_tld(url,as_object=True)
    print(res.fld)
This script also works with .txt files.
